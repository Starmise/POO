# POO
This repository is for the Object Oriented Programming class. It has solutions for basic topics of the subject, a text adventure and most importantly, Programming Patterns.

Within the main Programming Patterns solution, you can try 8 different types of patterns (most of them with examples), which are:
-Singleton
-Factory
-AbstractFactory
-Builder
-Adapter
-Prototype
-Decorator
-Composite
To see each one in main, simply remove the /**/ symbols to make the corresponding code usable. By default they are all disabled.
